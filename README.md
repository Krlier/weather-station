# Weather-Station

## What is this project about?

This is a home-made weather-station built with Arduino UNO that outputs its readings to [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com/).

## What components does it use?

* [Arduino Shield - Ethernet W5500](https://www.robocore.net/shields-arduino/arduino-shield-ethernet-w5500/)
* [MQ135 Module - Toxic Gases Sensor](https://www.robocore.net/sensor-gas/modulo-sensor-de-gases-toxicos-mq-135/)
* [BMP280 - Pressure and Temperature Sensor](https://www.robocore.net/sensor-ambiente/sensor-de-pressao-e-temperatura-bmp280/)
* [DHT11 - Temperature and Humidity Sensor](https://www.robocore.net/sensor-ambiente/sensor-de-temperatura-dht11/)
* Anemometer
* Rainmeter
* Wind Direction Indicator
* [400 pins protoboard](https://www.robocore.net/protoboard/protoboard-400-pontos/)
